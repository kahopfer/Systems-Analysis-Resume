        help develop projects using Java, Spring (a Java framework), and MongoDB (a NoSQL database).</li>
</ul>
<br/>

<h3>BUSINESS EDUCATION AND EXPERIENCE</h3>
<h4>Education</h4>

    <li>I have taken courses in financial accounting, managerial accounting, introduction to business, business law,
        microeconomics, macroeconomics, finance, business statistics, operations management, and management and
        organizational behavior.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Experience</h4>
<ul>
    <li>I have been an intern at Centene Corporation since May of 2016.</li>
</ul>
<br/>

<h3>GPA</h3>

    <li>UMSL GPA: 4.0</li>

</ul>
<br/>

<h3>SELF-RATING OF MY ABILITY TO COORDINATE TEAM PROJECTS</h3>
<ul>
    <li>8/10</li>
    <li>I am good at taking the initiative and reaching out to my teammates to coordinate our schedules so we can
        successfully complete our task on time. I put that skill to use on our first group assignment that we had to do
        this semester. A week before the assignment was due, I reached out to my teammates by email so we could figure
        out what times would work for us to meet and what methods we could use to complete our task.</li>
</ul>
<br/>

<h3>SELF-RATING OF MY CREATIVITY</h3>
<ul>
    <li>7/10</li>
    <li>I have had to come up with numerous creative solutions to solve software problems at my job. I have also been
        involved with musical ensembles since I was in the fifth grade. While in those ensembles, I don't just read the
        notes, but I creatively add various styles and inflections to my sound. My biggest issue with creativity is that
        once I come up with a unique idea, it seems that many of my ideas after that are similar to the first one.</li>
</ul>
<br/>

<h3>SELF-RATING OF MY COMMUNICATION SKILLS</h3>
<ul>
    <li>6/10</li>
    <li>I have had to communicate a lot with others for various group projects in school and work. While I am good at
        writing professional emails and text messages, I sometimes struggle with getting my point across or explaining
        things when speaking with others in person.</li>
</ul>
<br/>

<h3>RATING OF ANALYTICAL SKILLS</h3>
<ul>
    <li>9/10</li>
    <li>I have developed a strong set of analytical skills from taking two Java classes and a database class while at
        UMSL. I have put those skills to use at my job where I have helped develop many Java applications.</li>
</ul>
<br/>

<h3>RATING OF MY PROJECT MANAGEMENT SKILLS</h3>
<ul>
    <li>8/10</li>
    <li>I am very organized and good at making sure my tasks get done on time. Throughout my time at school, I have
        turned in most, if not all, of my projects and assignments on time. I use many tools to help keep myself
        organized, including a physical planner, a calendar app, and a reminders app on my computer and phone.</li>
</ul>
<br/>

<h3>EXPERIENCE RELEVANT TO THE PROJECT AREA</h3>
<ul>
    <li>I volunteered from 2009-2014 at Bethesda Southgate, which is a non-profit nursing home in St. Louis. While at
        Bethesda, I helped host games and activities for the nursing home residents. I have also volunteered for many
        other non-profit organizations through my church.</li>
</ul>
<br/>

<h3>KNOWLEDGE OF WEB PAGES</h3>
<ul>
    <li>I have a very basic knowledge of HTML (as you can see by this simple web page!)</li>
</ul>
<br/>

<h3>GREATEST STRENGTH I WILL BRING TO MY TEAM</h3>
<ul>
    <li>My above average time management and organization skills are the greatest assets I will bring to my team.</li>
</ul>
<br/>

<h3>GREATEST WEAKNESS I WILL BRING TO MY TEAM</h3>
<ul>
    <li>My occasional trouble with getting my point across while talking to others in person is the greatest weakness I will
        bring to my team.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
